# Compose Sandbox
Compose Sandbox is an open-source prototyping tool for the new Jetpack Compose UI framework. 

# Terminology
**"app"** - Compose Sandbox (aka this app itself)
**"prototype"** - the designs users can make in the app

# Download
At this point, the only way to download the app is to clone this repository and compile it through Android Studio Canary (since Jetpack Compose can only be run in Canary builds of AS)
