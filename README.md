# Compose Sandbox
Compose Sandbox is an open-source prototyping tool for the new Jetpack Compose UI framework. 

# Terminology
Since this app is written in Jetpack Compose, and also produces app prototypes that use Compose, the following terminology will be used throughout the project:

**"app"** - Compose Sandbox (aka this app itself)

**"prototype"** - objects representing the UI design users make in the app
- can be used to refer to different things, like "prototype component" or "prototype screen"

# Download
At this point, the only way to download the app is to clone this repository and compile it through Android Studio Canary (since Jetpack Compose can only be run in Canary builds of AS)
